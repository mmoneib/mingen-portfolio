# Minimalist Generated Portfolio
## Description
A minimalist, flow-oriented, easily generated portfolio of hierarchical sections, each containing its stream of items, each item having its own type, which influence how it is displayed.
## Core Principles of Design
1. **Compactness:** As minimal branching and artefacts as possible to allow a streamlined process of adding new content. Necessity dictates complexity level.
1. **Configurability:**  A rigid structure with guided customizability through CSS and classification of sections and items.
1. **Centrality:** Limitless number of pages withing a single page, updated through a push-to-publish mechanism.
## Justification of Unpopular Decisions
* CSS is included in the single-page HTML to discourage over-complicated styling.
* JavaScript is included in the single-page HTML for the same reason as above.
* Only standard stack is used to disallow any needless dependencies.
